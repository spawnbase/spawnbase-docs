title: Manual Trigger
description: Run agents on demand
---

The Manual trigger lets you run an agent on demand — no schedule or webhook required. Every agent can be triggered manually, even if it has another trigger configured.

## Usage

Click **Run** in the agent editor to execute the workflow immediately. Manual runs use the same execution pipeline as scheduled or webhook-triggered runs.

## When to Use

- Testing and debugging workflows during development
- One-off tasks that don't need automation
- Agents that are triggered by humans rather than events
