## Quick Example

```
"Every morning at 9am, check my GitHub issues,
summarize the urgent ones, and post to #engineering in Slack"
```

The copilot turns this into a complete workflow:
1. **Schedule Trigger** - Fires daily at 9am
2. **GitHub Action** - Fetches open issues labeled "urgent"
3. **AI Step** - Summarizes the issues using Claude
4. **Slack Action** - Posts the summary to #engineering
